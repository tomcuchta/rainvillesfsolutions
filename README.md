# Solutions to Earl D. Rainville's "Special Functions"

"Special Functions" by Rainville is a classic text in the theory of special functions. This document includes a mostly completed solution manual for the text. The solutions grew out of the solutions handwritten by Sylvester Pagano, furthered by Leon Hall, and typeset by Tom Cuchta.

## Getting Started

To get a full copy of the solutions, either download the zip file from the main github page or use a terminal and the following code:
<pre>git clone https://github.com/tomcuchta/rainvillesfsolutions.git</pre>

If you can solve one of the remaining problems, please push your solution to the repository OR e-mail your solution to tomcuchta@gmail.com. Full credit will be given to whoever solves them. If mistakes are found in the document, please do the same and you will be credited with a contribution.

## Compiling

You will need to compile the "rainville solutions.tex" file twice to get the table of contents to appear correctly.
